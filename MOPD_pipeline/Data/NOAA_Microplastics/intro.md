## Overview

The NCEI Marine Microplastics database provides global aggregated data on microplastics in marine environments. It aims to support water quality monitoring, ecosystem protection, and remote sensing validation, especially for vulnerable coastal habitats such as salt marshes and mangroves.

This geodatabase is essential for informing strategies to mitigate microplastic pollution, which threatens marine biodiversity, fisheries, and human health.

## Key Features

- Global coverage from surface waters to deep-sea sediments  
- Data collected from research cruises and field studies  
- Supports validation of satellite-based microplastics detection  
- Interactive GIS-based portal for exploration and download

## Environmental & Social Impact

- Microplastics (<5 mm) originate from plastics, clothes, and cosmetics  
- Ingested by marine life, they may cause toxicity, behavioral changes, or death  
- 11% of global plastic waste entered aquatic ecosystems in 2016 (19–23 million metric tons), projected to rise to 53 million metric tons/year by 2030  
- Threatens seafood supply for ~1.4 billion people relying on fish protein

## Data Access & Tools

- **Portal:** Microplastics Map Portal  
- **Functions:**
  - Filter-based downloads by region and time  
  - Full dataset export  
  - Metadata on sampling methods and instruments
