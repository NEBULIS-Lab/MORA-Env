## Abstract

This dataset is a comprehensive global marine biodiversity dataset integrating marine species occurrence data from OBIS and GBIF. It includes over **200 million records** of species occurrences and **122 million sampling site records**, covering the years **1600 to 2021**.

Each record includes essential attributes such as `eventDate`, `depth`, `latitude`, and `longitude`. Additionally, the dataset provides environmental variables at the sampling sites, comprising **13 key parameters**:

- Temperature  
- Salinity  
- Sea Currents  
- Chlorophyll  
- Nitrate  
- Phosphate  
- Silicate  
- Dissolved Molecular Oxygen  
- Net Primary Productivity  
- Dissolved Iron  
- Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressure  
- pH Value  
- Phytoplankton Carbon Concentration  

The environmental data are sourced from the **Copernicus Data Center** and are essential for ecological, biogeographical, and climate change studies.
